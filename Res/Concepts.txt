A Node represents any device in the internet whether it can be a part of Vanet, FANET or RSU
A Node can have multiple interfaces. The possible reason could be to connect to multiple networks
For each interface, there will be a different NetDevice associated with it.


The general procedure to be followed for simulation:
followed from the example of AODV 

1 Create Nodes
  Create nodes as required for the system
  Assign the IDS or names for nodes, can be done using Names::Add which will store string 
  to object mapping and can be acessed anywhere
  Add the Mobility model to the nodes
2 Create Devices
  Create net devices(for interfaces) for the nodes
  For wifi devices, setup the physical and mac layers of the device, then install on nodes 
3 Install Internet stack
  Set the type of routing protocol that you want to run on your nodes
  using the InternetStackHelper::SetRoutingHelper
4 Install Applications
  Install the application that you want to run on your devices
  This application is responsible for what data to be transmitted and how the devices behave
  It interacts with network stack to send packets


Mobility Model:
To keep track of current position and velocity of a Node
Position co-ordiantes and velocity are in m and m/s units


Final Combined Protocol:
A final protocol having three protocol objects inside it
It will ask the methods from three routing protocols to decide which one to use
