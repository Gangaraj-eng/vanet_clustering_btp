Adding this module into ns3 : 
The CMakeLists.txt file specifies the header files and source files of this module with their paths
To start using these, run the following commands from top level directory.
1.configuring
./ns3 configure --enable-examples --enable-tests --enable-logs --enable-asserts
2.Building
./ns3 build
The above two commands need to be run whenever new header files or source files are added 
By doing this we can use our header files by importing them like #include "ns3/ourheaderfile.h"

To run a file:
For running a file, we need to move that file into scratch folder, doing this every time is hectic and it will fills 
the scratch folder, so we can move it to scratch temporarily and then delete it again using the following script that I 
had created. Add the below code into a new file with name Run_File.sh in top level directory

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a file path is provided as an argument
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Error: Please provide a file path as an argument."
  exit 1
fi

# Get the file path
file_path="$1"

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f "$file_path" ]; then
  echo "Error: File '$file_path' does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Extract the filename using parameter expansion
filename="${file_path##*/}"

# Extract the file without extension
file_without_extension="${filename%. *}"

# Create the scratch folder if it doesn't exist

# Move the file to the scratch folder
cp "$file_path" "./scratch/$filename"

# Print the extracted information
echo ""
echo "Running the file..."
echo ""

./ns3 run "scratch/$file_without_extension"

rm "./scratch/$filename"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set the permission of the Run_File file to be executable
Then to run any file, you can run using the command from top level directory
./Run_File.sh <path-to-the-file

// for example you can run the sample.cc using 
./Run_File.sh ./src/btp/sample.cc
